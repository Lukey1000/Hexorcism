Some recent examples of interesting questions I have received in Cyber Security job interviews.

<!--more-->

# Intro 

I've been through around 16 job interviews for various cyber roles lately. Most of these I applied for purely to remember how to interview - as prior to June 2022, I hadn't had a 'real' job interview for 7 years - you know, where it's a dream job and you absolutely don't want to screw it up which just adds a whole additional layer of stress.

Some of the jobs were below my level, some were above, some were GRC, some were DFIR, some management. I got offered 6 jobs, came 2nd on two which were stretch goals for my level of experience, and ended up taking none of them because they couldn't match the conditions at my current employer. My wife thought I was crazy applying for so many jobs but I did so for multiple reasons:

1. To even find out how much they are willing to pay you, how much they are willing to invest in training, half of the time you seem to need to have an offer in your hands. I don't know how many times I asked questions about the basic conditions of a work place like *What's your parental leave policy?* and the hiring manager had no idea, and said I'd have to contact HR later.

2. Having a well crafted resume, writing cover letters, and interviewing well are all skills. When you don't use them, they get rusty. In June 2022 I absolutely floundered in an important interview. I couldn't even string an answer together for *What's your greatest technical skill?* with 15 years of technical work behind me. It's astonishing just how much better I am at interviews now, and how much more comfortable I am as a result.

# Observations

I wrote a lot of the interesting questions down. I was assaulted by many of the bog standard 'Tell us about yourself" dull as dog shit questions by people who didn't even know what they were asking or why. These were the organisations, mostly, were there was a panel with maybe one person who even understood what you were saying if you got technical. Unfortunately, these are still **extremely** common and you're going to have to have answers prepared for all of those, for example:
- Tell us about yourself
- Tell us about a time you made a mistake
- When did you solve a problem creatively?
- What's your greatest technical skill?
- Why do you want to work here?

You'd be silly not to have great examples hand picked and ready for all of these.

On to the actually interesting questions.

*What, in your opinion, are the three major issues impacting the cyber security landscape in Australia today?*

I thought that this was a great question. It could allow a well researched, well informed person to speak, and even those technical folk who aren't great at talking about themselves would be much more capable of pulling out an answer - simply talk about their three greatest challenges lately. I'm sure that the panel received a very diverse set of answers that told them significantly more about the candidate than "tell us about yourself".

*How would you go about scanning an entire environment for a particular file and then deleting it?*

I like these types of hypotheticals. I think that it opens up a technical, problem solving part of my brain and allows a proper back and forth between you and the hiring manager - if they're technical. Simply asking some questions to establish the lay of the land in this hypothetical can show so much about your understanding and experience. There's so many valid answers here too, you'd really get some variety in answers.

*I'm going to ask you a series of questions on DLL Hijacking. They will become increasingly difficult. I don't expect you to be able to answer them all, especially off the top of your head. Why don't you start by telling me your understanding of DLL Hijacking?*

This was quite an experience, it led to a roughly 15-20 minute back and forth. I had somewhat luckily just completed a module on HTB academy that went pretty in depth on detecting DLL Hijacking, and sat for a SANS exam with multiple DLL Hijacking questions so I was as prepared as I realistically could be. The interviewer continued to throw further curve balls at me like *What if the environment has no SIEM and you have to use event viewer?* The only problem is, you could have an amazing person in every way that's just not that familiar with DLL Hijacking, because every environment they've been in is secured by airlock or some such that just makes it...not happen. I feel like the question would be even better if you gave 3-4 different topics for the interviewee to dive deep on, or even let them choose the one they know best. If I was asked the same question today, the knowledge is nowhere near as fresh, so I'd do nowhere near as good. Does that mean I don't know it?

*Please provide an example of your experience on evaluating or investigating a system?*
  *a. What was your involvement in the review/assessment/implementation process?*
  *b. What regulatory requirements were used?*
  *c. What tools did you use?*
  *d. How was this process documented?*

Just a great, indepth, role related question. Ditch the CAR/STAR format and ask the questions that actually matter like this. They provided about 5 minutes to prepare for this question as well. 

*You're in charge of a team that's dealing with a patch gone wrong causing an org wide outage. Your bosses boss approaches you and asks you to assist the CEO with something urgently. How do you proceed?*

Again, great hypothetical. You may have never had the luck of people breaking the chain of command in an environment where everyone logs a ticket. Certainly I've seen places where this would never occur. Rather than asking for an example of when, they set up a bad situation and get people to react and plan out a response. I think you would get a wide variety of answers to this that really showcase whether someone can prioritise and how they prioritise.

Lastly, I had an interview for a Senior DFIR consultant position where, for the second round, they simply gave me access to an environment with a PCAP, a $MFT and $Logfile, and some firewall logs and said *Write a report and presentation, and present your findings to us. You've got a week, don't spend too much time on it, it's ok to write down what you would do next as well.*

On one hand, you could spend a lot of time on this and not get hired. On the other hand, you get to showcase your hard earned knowledge and ability without time pressure. Some people might like it, some might hate it, but it was surely effective at showing whether someone can do the job far more than interview questions ever could.

Cheers,

Luke
