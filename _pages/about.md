About Me
--------

Hi, I'm Luke Brown. I'm an Information and Cyber Security Professional with an interest in DFIR and Red teaming. There's a few reasons I am starting this blog:

 1.  While completing the Reverse Engineering Malware course in my master's degree, my lecturer suggested that there's no better way to keep learning than to start a blog to document your process.

 2.  A place to consolidate and publish my study notes and lessons learnt related to various skills and certifications. 

 3.  I can't count the number of times that I have been looking for an ultra specific command or bit of information about some obscure forensics concept and found it on someone's blog. So, I hope that in a few years, someone else finds the answer they are looking for here.
