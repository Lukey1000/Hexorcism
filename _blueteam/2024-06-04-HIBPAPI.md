HIBP's API is powerful and simple. Here's one example of a neat way to begin using it.

<!--more-->

If you're a paid subscriber, you can generate an API Key by logging into the web portal.

Note: if you are working in an environment requiring web auth for powershell queries (proxy, etc) an easy trick to use your existing auth is:

``` powershell
$browser = New-Object System.Net.Webclient
$browser.Proxy.Credentials = [System.Net.CredentialCache]::DefaultNetworkCredentials
```

``` powershell
function GET-HIBPEmailData($email) {
  $apiKey = "YOURAPIKEY"
  $headers = @{"hibp-api-key" = $apiKey}
  $encodedEmail = [System.Web.HttpUtility]::UrlEncode($email)
  $baseUrl = "https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breachedaccount"
  $truncateFlag = "?truncateResponse=false"
  $combinedUrl = $baseUrl + $encodedEmail + $truncateFlag
  Write-Host Checking $email now...

  $response = $null
  try {
      [array]$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $combinedUrl -headers $headers -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
  }
  catch {
      if($error[0].Exception.response.Statuscode -match "NotFound"){
          Write-Host "No Breach detected for $email" -ForegroundColor Green
      }else{
          Write-Host "Cannot retrieve Results"
      }
  }
  if ($response) {
      return $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json | FL Title, BreachDate, AddedDate, Description, IsVerified, IsSensitive
  }
}
```

Then simply run Get-HIBPEmailData -email first.last@domain.com!

There's a ton more ways to use this like doing a foreach for every mailbox in your domain, or using the breached domain API call to get a summary of the most recent breach for each user in your domain. Note that it's rate limited so that these queries can take quite some time in large environments.
